Things to note:

- This is not the final version of the terrain generation algorithm and it is by no means complete

- This does not generate an island yet



Plan/ideas (subject to change):

- Could generate an island by stitching 4 generated maps together by their highest elevation sides and then lower each quadrant by their respective lowest elevation tiles

-
